## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**:

TypeScript is "better" JavaScript, that allows to work with types of values and more. Didn't know it was created by Microsoft.

I learned how to set up TypeScript in project, how to configure it, how to compile it in .js file.

2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**:

I learned how to declare variable types, about any, unknown, their difference.

Using any type is not a good idea, but unknown type for me does make some sense in some situations.

3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**:

I used interfaces in different programming languages, for example Java. It is very useful, especially in OOP. Cool that TypeScript allows to work with them.

Variables inside still need type declaration.

Implementing them in project is must-have knowledge i think. 

4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**:

Function return type also can be declared, and it can be any function (classic, arrow or variable as function).

Feature to assign function parameter with ? or default value might be useful.

When I developed my projects with TS, often used them, especially ?.
